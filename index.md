All around the globe, French tech engineers are recognized for their skills, but they suffer from a lack of a real global association. So we built one.


while42 chapters
=================

{% include home/map.html %}

We are organized by chapters. Each chapter represents a city and his members and has one or more managers, organizers, catalysts (we call them **root**, see the list on the right).
If you want to create a while42 chapter in your city, you can contact us at this email: c3lsdmFpbkBrYWxhY2hlLmZy==


Values / Rules
===============

## 0. French only
To become a member of while42, you should be either a French tech OR someone speaking French and having a computer science degree delivered by a French school / university.

## 1. Tech Engineers only
All while42 members are tech engineers (developers, ops, devops, sys-admin, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlarCLhzfoU">ingenieurs informaticiens</a>, CTO ...) and/or have a degree from a french engineering tech school ([Epitech](http://www.epitech.net), [Supinfo](http://www.supinfo.com), [Epita](http://www.epita.fr), ...). There is no filter by degree or school. You do not have to have a degree to join as soon as you are a tech engineer (and french).

## 2. Real network, real people
Everybody should know each other in each chapter. The goal is **NOT** to be as big as possible. We do not want to be a big organization where you don’t know who is standing next to you. Thus we will never be very much per chapter, and each chapter is growing slowly after the first 50 members.

## 42. No asshole
We do not want haters or people attending only to eat free food.
